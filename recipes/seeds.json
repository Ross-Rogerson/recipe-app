Place in a wide bowl.Combine the marinade ingredients in a food processor and blend to a smooth paste. Tip the paste onto the chicken, add 2 tablespoons of the oil and massage thoroughly, carefully tucking some of the marinade under the skin and into the slashes. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours, or overnight for a more flavourful marinade and to tenderise tougher poultry.Remove the chicken from the fridge 30 minutes before cooking, to allow it to come up to room temperature. Preheat the grill to medium-high.Drizzle the chicken with the remaining oil. Toss well and arrange in one layer on an oiled grilling tray or rack with thighs skin-side up. Reserve any marinade left in the bowl. Grill each side for 10 minutes, until browned with a nice char on the skin. Set aside to finish cooking in the sauce.Meanwhile, to make the sauce, heat the oil in a wide saucepan and add the onions and any leftover marinade. Sprinkle with a pinch of fine sea salt, cover with a lid and cook over a medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring often, until the onions are translucent. Remove the lid and continue cooking uncovered for another 15–20 minutes, until the onions begin to brown and eventually caramelise in their natural sugars. Add a splash of water, if needed, to prevent burning.Add the pepper and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic until fragrant. Pour in the lime or lemon juice and add the Dijon mustard, chicken stock, thyme, bay leaf and scotch bonnet. Season with the sea salt and freshly ground pepper and bring to a simmer.Tuck the chicken, skin-side up, into the sauce. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the sauce is reduced and the chicken is cooked through.Taste to check the seasoning. If you find the sauce too tart, scoop out 2 tablespoons of sauce into a small bowl and add ½ teaspoon of honey, mix well then pour back into your sauce. Gently stir and taste again. Repeat with another ½ teaspoon of honey, if needed.Scatter with parsley and serve with simple sides, such as rice, steamed couscous, fonio or creamy mashed potatoes and green beans",

If cooking with tofu, season well with fine sea salt; if cooking with halloumi, season lightly.Meanwhile, if cooking with tofu, wrap it in a clean cloth and place in a colander in the sink with something heavy on top. Leave to drain for 30 minutes to remove excess moisture. If using halloumi, simply drain. Slice the tofu or halloumi into 1cm-thick slabs.Place the flour, spices, salt and black pepper in a bowl and mix well to combine.

Once hot, cook the tofu or halloumi in batches for 1–2 minutes on each side, until golden brown. Remove from the heat and transfer to a plate. Heat a little more oil and repeat until all the slices are cooked.Transfer the sauce to a warm platter and spread out. Place the fried halloumi or tofu on top and scatter over the sliced basil. Serve immediately on its own or with bread, such as My East African Chapati (see page 196 in Africana) or Medina Bread (see page 194 in Africana), to soak up the wonderful sauce",

Drain them in a colander to get rid of any excess water, then return to the pan on a low heat and mash.Flake the cooked fish into a large bowl, picking out any bones and removing the skin.Finely chop the parsley, mint and chilli, then bash the fennel seeds in a pestle and mortar.Add the mashed potato to the fish, along with the parsley, mint, chilli, fennel seeds, eggs and the zest of the lemons and limes. Season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Mix well, taste and add more salt if necessary.Flour your work surface, then take 1 tablespoon of the mix in your hands with a little flour and pat it into a flattened circle, rolling it in the flour. Rough and ready is good, so don’t worry about having them all exactly the same!Pour enough oil into a large heavy-bottomed saucepan to fill the pan about a third of the way up. Heat over a medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted into the oil reaches 185°C/360°F. (If you don’t have a thermometer, heat the oil until a cube of bread will brown in about 3 minutes.)Deep-fry the fishcakes for about 5 minutes until brown and crispy. Drain on kitchen paper, sprinkle with sea salt and serve on a large plate with lots of lemon halves",

Do the dark meat first, skin-side down, turning. When the chicken is golden all over, cooked through and perfectly juicy with a crunchy crust, it's done.

Leave to one side.Mix the aubergines, courgettes, onions and tomato sauce together in a large bowl and check that everything is seasoned well.Use the remaining olive oil to oil a baking dish, then place a layer of lasagne sheets in the base of the dish. Add one-third of the vegetable mixture in an even layer, then top this with one-quarter of the béchamel sauce. Repeat this twice more, then finish with a layer of lasagne sheets and a final layer of béchamel sauce. Sprinkle the top with some more Parmesan, then bake the lasagne for 35 minutes, until the pasta is cooked and the top is golden. Serve with a little extra grated Parmesan on top, if you like",

Finely grate the Parmesan into a small bowl, then beat in the egg. Put a 28cm frying pan on a high heat.Once hot, put a little drizzle of olive oil into the pan with the bacon, rosemary and a generous pinch of black pepper. When lightly golden, add the mushrooms. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring regularly, then scatter the pasta into the pan. Carefully pour in enough boiling kettle water to just cover the pasta – about 300ml. Let it bubble away for 4 minutes, or until the pasta has absorbed most of the water, stirring regularly. Turn the heat off, let it sit for just 30 seconds, then stir in the egg mixture, shaking and stirring vigorously until you have a delicate, silky sauce – you need it to be off the heat so you don’t scramble the egg, but equally you need to keep it moving to get a smooth sauce. Season to perfection, and finish with a kiss of extra virgin olive oil and an extra grating of Parmesan, if you like",

Pick in most of the basil leaves (finely chop and reserve the stalks), 1 of the chillies, the red wine vinegar and a lug of oil. Season lightly and blitz to a paste.Remove the prawn shells, leaving the tails on. Butterfly the prawns by cutting along the back of each, and opening them up like a book.Place into a bowl, add the basil paste, and mix well to coat. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave to marinate in the fridge for a few hours, or ideally overnight.Score a cross in the top of each tomato, pop them in a large bowl and cover with boiling water. Leave them for a minute or so, until the skin starts to peel away.Drain the tomatoes and leave to cool slightly, then peel off the skins (discard them) and roughly chop the flesh. Set aside.Just before you want to cook the prawns, prepare your sauce. Place a saucepan over a medium heat and add a lug of oil. Chop the aubergines into 3cm cubes, then fry for 10 minutes, or until golden and starting to soften, stirring frequently.Deseed and finely slice the remaining chilli, then peel and finely slice the rest of the garlic. Add both into the pan, followed by the oregano and basil stalks. Fry for a few minutes, then stir in the tomatoes.Add a few splashes of water, bring it to a simmer, then reduce the heat a little and keep it simmering for about 30 minutes, until the aubergine has cooked down and the sauce is thick.Just before the sauce is done, place a griddle pan over a high heat. Once it’s screaming hot, cook your prawns for 1½ minutes on each side, until charred, pink and cooked. Drop the prawns into the sauce as you go.Stir the remaining basil leaves into the sauce, then serve it topped with a few rocket leaves, if you like",

Season with black pepper, then add the marinade, and toss to coat.Halve, deseed and cut the peppers into chunks, and cut the lemons into wedges, then thread onto 8 skewers, alternating between lamb, pepper, bay leaves and lemon wedges.Lay the skewers on a baking tray and roast in the hot oven for about 10 to 15 minutes, or until charred, sticky and cooked through, turning occasionally. Keep an eye on them – rotate the tray so that all the kebabs get a turn of being close to the fire and pull them back a little if the bread starts to burn.Pick and roughly chop the parsley leaves, then scatter over the kebabs.

Add a good lug of extra virgin olive oil, correct the seasoning and set aside.Preheat a griddle pan to high. Thread the marinated chicken pieces onto 4 skewers – if you're using wooden ones, make sure you soak them in water first to stop them burning and also cut them to size, if necessary. Griddle the chicken kebabs for around 10 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning regularly.Meanwhile, pop your flatbreads in the oven to warm through.To serve, place the flatbreads onto 4 plates and pop a skewer on top of each one.
